**Cleaning and Visualizing MTA turnstile data**  
This repository contains the workbook and presentation for the first project in Metis' Data Science program. The topic of the project was to use the mta turnstile data available [at the mta site] (http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html).  

A write up on how the data was cleaned can be found [here] (https://abhisekswain.github.io/).
