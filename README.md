### Project1 - MTA-data-cleaning-and-visualization
**Cleaning and Visualizing MTA turnstile data**  

This repository contains the workbook for the first project in Metis' Data Science bootcamp. The goal of the project was to analyze mta turnstile data available at the mta site (http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) and recommend where street teams should be placed to optimize signups for an upcoming gala orgainzed by Women Tech Women Yes.
